                <h1> Music </h1>
                
                <p> I first began playing the piano as a child, and in middle school I discovered the trumpet, which quickly became my main instrument. I’ve been playing for over ten years and currently perform with the Oakland University Brass Band and Symphonic Band. This year is especially exciting, as our Brass Band tied for first place in a regional competition and will be traveling to Moscow this summer to compete on the international stage. </p>

                <h1> Animal Care </h1>
                
                <p> I’ve always been passionate about the environment, especially when it comes to caring for animals. I have a dog of my own and regularly volunteer at animal shelters to spend time with animals in need. While I’m still searching for a nearby shelter to volunteer at consistently, I’m eager to continue finding ways to support animal welfare in my community. </p>

                <h1> Arts & Crafts </h1>
        
                <p> I love expressing my creativity through arts and crafts, whether it’s making decorations or working on small projects. As a residential assistant, I’ve especially enjoyed creating door decorations and themed displays for my residents. It’s a great way to combine creativity with community building, and it has quickly become one of my favorite parts of the job. </p>
